# Personal Reflection — Kateryna

At the beginning of the course, I did not expect the project to be so challenging. The difficulties started when Hugo and I began developing our project idea. Unfortunately, neither of us had prior experience with Unity, which meant that we had to learn the technology completely from scratch. We found the AR concept motivating; however, we underestimated the complexity of working with large-scale 3D models and performance constraints. In particular, integrating a 3D scan of Horsens train station proved to be technically demanding due to file size, optimization requirements, and hardware limitations.

During the AR project, my main contribution focused on understanding and working with prepared 3D scan data. I worked with a converted `.fbx` model in Blender, where I focused on cleaning the geometry and learning how such models are prepared for use in Unity.

Working with the Meta Quest headset was also a new and valuable experience for me. I spent several hours installing and configuring the device on my personal computer. Although I was able to build and run the project, I could not access the Unity console for error tracking, which limited debugging. This experience helped me understand the importance of simulation environments in Unity and the advantages of using fully equipped lab computers for XR development.

Hugo took a larger role in technical implementation, particularly because much of the work had to be carried out in the XRD lab using high-performance computers, as our personal laptops were not powerful enough to handle the project requirements. We collaborated through GitHub, which introduced additional collaboration challenges. At times, we worked in separate branches on similar tasks to better understand Unity and explore alternative approaches, which contributed to my learning even when not all work was reflected directly in the final implementation.

The project would likely have benefited from having at least one team member with prior XR experience or from a more extended development period. Throughout the course, Kasper was supportive and provided valuable guidance on both theoretical and practical aspects of XR development.

In conclusion, this course enabled me to gain both theoretical and practical knowledge in XR development. My contribution was primarily focused on conceptual understanding, documentation, user experience considerations, and reflection, while also supporting technical tasks where possible. This project helped me better understand the realities of XR development, including hardware limitations, performance optimization, and collaborative workflows.

For future projects, I would like to be more involved in the implementation phase and build on the experience gained, while remaining aware that XR technologies evolve rapidly and require continuous learning.
